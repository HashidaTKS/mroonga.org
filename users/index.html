  <h2>LayBrick beta</h2>
  <p><a href="http://laybrick.com/">LayBrick beta, The Art of Social Network</a></p>
  <p>LayBrick is personal searchable Twitter, Facebook and Instagram client. What not only I can read each service at the same time, but also can find out necessary information from an intelligence network only for you by an abundant search option features it.</p>
  <p>Tweets from Twitter, posts and link descriptions from Facebook, captions from Instagram and so on are stored into database. They can be found by mroonga's full text search. Mroonga is used in wrapper mode and wrapped storage engine is InnoDB. Mroonga is very fine because it's more flexible rather than Senna + Tritonn.</p>
