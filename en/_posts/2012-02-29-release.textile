h2. Mroonga 2.00 has been released

"Mroonga 2.00":/docs/news.html#release-2-00 has been released!

How to install:: "Install":/docs/install.html

h3. CAUTION!!!

This release requires database dump and restore for upgrading. Here are upgrade sequence.

In this release, mroonga has two changes that requires database recreation:

# Supported all characters for database, table and column names.
# Groonga's native time data type is used for YEAR type in MySQL.

We dump a database that uses mroonga:

<pre>
% mysqldump MY_MROONGA_DATABASE > database-mroonga.dump
</pre>

We drop the existing database:

<pre>
% mysql -u root -e 'DROP DATABASE MY_MROONGA_DATABASE'
</pre>

We upgrade to "mroonga" storage engine. We will use apt-get on Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu and yum on CentOS or Fedora.

apt-get:

<pre>
% sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server-mroonga
</pre>

yum:

<pre>
% sudo yum remove -y mysql-mroonga
% sudo yum install -y mysql-mroonga
</pre>

Caution: We don't forget to run yum remove before yum install. If we forget to run yum remove, we will break a MySQL's system table.

We recreate a database:

<pre>
% mysql -u root -e 'CREATE DATABASE MY_MROONGA_DATABASE'
</pre>

We restore a database by modified dump file:

<pre>
% mysql -u root MY_MROONGA_DATABASE < database-mroonga.dump
</pre>

Now, we can use mroonga 2.00.
