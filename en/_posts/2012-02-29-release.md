## Mroonga 2.00 has been released

[Mroonga 2.00](/docs/news.html#release-2-00) has been released!

How to install:: [Install](/docs/install.html)

### CAUTION![]()!

This release requires database dump and restore for upgrading. Here are
upgrade sequence.

In this release, mroonga has two changes that requires database
recreation:

1.  Supported all characters for database, table and column names.
2.  Groonga's native time data type is used for YEAR type in MySQL.

We dump a database that uses mroonga:

    % mysqldump MY_MROONGA_DATABASE > database-mroonga.dump

We drop the existing database:

    % mysql -u root -e 'DROP DATABASE MY_MROONGA_DATABASE'

We upgrade to "mroonga" storage engine. We will use apt-get on Debian
GNU/Linux or Ubuntu and yum on CentOS or Fedora.

apt-get:

    % sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server-mroonga

yum:

    % sudo yum remove -y mysql-mroonga
    % sudo yum install -y mysql-mroonga

Caution: We don't forget to run yum remove before yum install. If we
forget to run yum remove, we will break a MySQL's system table.

We recreate a database:

    % mysql -u root -e 'CREATE DATABASE MY_MROONGA_DATABASE'

We restore a database by modified dump file:

    % mysql -u root MY_MROONGA_DATABASE < database-mroonga.dump

Now, we can use mroonga 2.00.
