## Mroonga official site URL is changed

Mroonga official site uses [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) .
The previous official site URL is http://mroonga.github.com/. GitHub
Pages changed URL to http://XXX.github.io/ a few weeks ago.

Mroonga project gets a domain name mroonga.org and use it as the
official site URL. The new official site URL is <http://mroonga.org/> !

You can still access mroonga official site by mroonga.github.com and
mroonga.github.io.

Please use http://mroonga.org/ when you link to mroonga!
