### Fixes

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html) Fixed a bug that we have not provided the package of Mroonga for MariaDB 10.6.

* [Optimizations](/docs/reference/optimizations.html) Fixed a bug that Mroonga apply the optimization of row count wrongly.

  Normally, Mroonga apply the optimization of row count when the ``SELECT`` fetches only ``COUNT(*)`` and
  condition in ``WHERE`` can be processed only by index.

  However, Mroonga applied the optimization of row count even if Mroonga couldn't process condition
  in ``WHERE`` only by index as below case by this bug.

  Consequently, the result of ``SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE ...`` is wrong.

    ```
    CREATE TABLE roles (
      id INT
    );

    INSERT INTO roles VALUES (1), (2), (3), (4), (5);

    CREATE TABLE users (
      id INT,
      role_id INT,
      INDEX (role_id)
    );

    INSERT INTO users VALUES (10, 1);
    INSERT INTO users VALUES (11, 2);
    INSERT INTO users VALUES (13, 3);
    INSERT INTO users VALUES (14, 4);
    INSERT INTO users VALUES (15, 5);
    INSERT INTO users VALUES (20, 1);
    INSERT INTO users VALUES (21, 2);
    INSERT INTO users VALUES (23, 3);
    INSERT INTO users VALUES (24, 4);
    INSERT INTO users VALUES (25, 5);

    SELECT COUNT(*)
      FROM (
        SELECT roles.id
          FROM roles
               LEFT JOIN users ON users.id <= 100 AND
                                  users.role_id = roles.id
      ) roles_users;
    ```

* Fixed a bug that Mroonga doesn't set proper encoding on condition push down for 'STRING_FIELD ='.

  Mroonga executes condition push down for 'STRING_FIELD =' in the following case.
  However, Mroonga doesn't set proper encoding in search keywords at this time.
  Consequently, Mroonga fails to normalize search keywords.

    ```
    CREATE TABLE memos (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      title TEXT,
      INDEX (title)
    ) ENGINE=Mroonga DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

    INSERT INTO memos VALUES (1, 'Groonga');
    INSERT INTO memos VALUES (2, 'Mroonga');

    SELECT *
      FROM memos
      WHERE title = 'mroonga'
      ORDER BY id;
    ```

### Conclusion

Let's search by Mroonga!
