It is useful to analyze query where is bottle neck in Groonga.

Thanks Tomohiro 'Tomo-p' KATO for contributing to fix build error against MariaDB 10.2.7..

### Auto command syntax escape feature has been supported

In this release, auto command syntax escape feature has been supported.

You can specify command name and its argument separately in `mroonga_command`.

Using new syntax, arguments are automatically escaped, so you don't need to consider what query is actually passed to Groonga layer.

    SELECT mroonga_command('COMMAND_NAME',
                         'PARAMETER_NAME_1', 'PARAMETER_VALUE_1',
                         ...,
                         'PARAMETER_NAME_N', 'PARAMETER_VALUE_N');

Example:

    SELECT mroonga_command('select',
                           'table', 'diaries',
                           'filter', 'title @ "Groonga"');

It is useful for active `mroonga_command` user.

### Ubuntu 16.10 (Yekkety Yak) support has been dropped

In this release, Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) support was dropped. It has reached EOL at July 20, 2017.
