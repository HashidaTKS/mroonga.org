### Supported table level flags option.

In the previous version, when you create table in Mroonga, you could not set
Groonga's table flag. So, if you want create table for saving many big data,
you needed to use `mroonga_command`.

In this release, when you create table, you can specify `KEY_LARGE` flag.
You can more easy make table for save many big data from this.

Here is how to specify `KEY_LARGE`.

```sql
  CREATE TABLE diaries (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    content VARCHAR(255),
    FULLTEXT INDEX (content)
  ) ENGINE = Mroonga COMMENT = 'engine "InnoDB"' DEFAULT CHARSET utf8 flags "TABLE_HASH_KEY|KEY_LARGE";
```

In addition, you can specify `TABLE_HASH_KEY`, `TABLE_PAT_KEY`, and `TABLE_DAT_KEY` table options.
For details of each of `flags` which can specify, see the below documents.
