## Mroonga 4.07 has been released!

[Mroonga 4.07](/docs/news.html#release-4-07) has been released!

* How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)
* How to upgrade: [Upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade.html)

### Changes

In this release, two big experimental features:

  * Column value compression support
  * Token filter support

#### Column value compression support

In this release, Mroonga has supported column compression by zlib or LZ4.

You can save disk spaces by this feature. This feature is implemented by [@naoa_y](https://twitter.com/naoa_y). Thanks!

Here is the pros/cons:

  * zlib: compression rate is better than LZ4, but performance is not.
  * LZ4: performance is good, but compression rate is not better than Zlib.

Add `COMPRESS_ZLIB` or `COMPRESS_LZ4` flag to `flags` in comment of column definition:

    content TEXT COMMENT 'flags "COLUMN_SCALAR|COMPRESS_ZLIB"'
    content TEXT COMMENT 'flags "COLUMN_SCALAR|COMPRESS_LZ4"'

Here is the brief benchmark provided by @naoa_y. It shows characteristics of each compression.
