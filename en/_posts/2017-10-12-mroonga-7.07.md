and fulltext search engine.

[Mroonga 7.07](/docs/news.html#release-7-07) has been released!

  * How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)
  * How to upgrade: [Upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade.html)

### Changes

Here are changes in this release.

  * `mroonga_query_expand` UDF has been supported
  * MariaDB 10.1/10.2 package has been supported on CentOS 6/7
  
### `mroonga_query_expand` UDF has been supported

In this release, `mroonga_query_expand` UDF has been supported.

Here is the sample schema to use this UDF.

    CREATE TABLE diaries (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
      content VARCHAR(255),
      FULLTEXT INDEX (content)
    ) ENGINE = Mroonga DEFAULT CHARSET utf8;
    
    CREATE TABLE synonyms (
      term varchar(255),
      synonym varchar(255),
      INDEX (term)
    ) ENGINE= Mroonga DEFAULT CHARSET utf8;

`diaries` is table for full text search. `synonym` table is used to define synonyms.

Then insert sample data:

    INSERT INTO synonyms VALUES ('Groonga', 'Groonga Mroonga Rroonga');

    INSERT INTO diaries (content) VALUES ("Groonga is fast.");
    INSERT INTO diaries (content) VALUES ("Mroonga is fast.");
    INSERT INTO diaries (content) VALUES ("PGroonga is fast.");

Let's use `mroonga_query_expand` UDF.

If you want to search with synonym term, just use `mroonga_query_expand("synonyms", "term", "synonym", "Groonga")`. This enable you to do full text search by 'Groonga', 'Mroonga', 'Roonga' at once even though specified term is only 'Groonga'.

    mysql> SELECT * FROM diaries WHERE MATCH(content) AGAINST(mroonga_query_expand("synonyms", "term", "synonym", "Groonga") IN BOOLEAN MODE);
    +----+------------------+
    | id | content          |
    +----+------------------+
    |  1 | Groonga is fast. |
    |  2 | Mroonga is fast. |
    +----+------------------+
