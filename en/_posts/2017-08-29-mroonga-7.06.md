[Mroonga 7.06](/docs/news.html#release-7-06) has been released!

  * How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)
  * How to upgrade: [Upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade.html)

Here are changes in this release.

  * Generated Column has been supported

### Generated Column has been supported

In this release, Generated Column has been supported!

Here is the sample schema to use generated column.

    CREATE TABLE logs (
      id INT,
      record JSON,
      message VARCHAR(255) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(`record`, '$.message')) STORED,
      FULLTEXT INDEX(message) comment 'tokenizer "TokenBigramSplitSymbolAlphaDigit"'
    ) ENGINE=Mroonga DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

As you can see, the partial value of `record` column is used as `message` column.

Then, you can do full text search against `message` column by the following query.

    > SELECT * FROM logs WHERE MATCH(message) AGAINST("ar" IN BOOLEAN MODE);
    +------+-----------------------------------------+-----------+
    | id   | record                                  | message   |
    +------+-----------------------------------------+-----------+
    |    1 | {"level": "info", "message": "start"}   | "start"   |
    |    2 | {"level": "info", "message": "restart"} | "restart" |
    +------+-----------------------------------------+-----------+
    2 rows in set (0.02 sec)

You can also define `VIRTUAL` without actual data column.

    CREATE TABLE logs (
      id INT,
      record JSON,
      message VARCHAR(255) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(`record`, '$.message')) VIRTUAL
    ) ENGINE=Mroonga DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
    
But note that `FULLTEXT INDEX(message)` is not supported yet.

### Conclusion
