* How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)
* How to upgrade: [Upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade.html)

### Changes

Here are changes in this release:

  * [RPM] Supported MySQL 5.6.28 and 5.7.10
  * Supported table name that includes `-` in script syntax
  * Added a new UDF `mroonga_normalize`
  * [wrapper mode] Really support `CHECK TABLE FOR UPGRADE`

#### [RPM] Supported MySQL 5.6.28 and 5.7.10

Supported MySQL 5.6.28 and 5.7.10 for RPM packages (mysql56-community-mroonga and mysql57-community-mroonga). See [2.5. CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html) for details how to install.

#### Supported table name that includes `-` in script syntax.

A table name that includes `-` can't be used in script syntax until 5.10 because it conflicts to index table name separator. Since 5.11, index table name separator is changed to ``#`` from ``-``. It makes that table name that includes ``-`` can be used in script syntax.

#### Added a new UDF `mroonga_normalize`

Mroonga provides some useful functionality as [UDF](/docs/reference/udf.html) (User Defined Functions).

TODO

#### [wrapper mode] Really support `CHECK TABLE FOR UPGRADE` (`mysql_update`).
