### Supported FT_SORTED flag in Mroonga

In this release, Mroonga has been supported `FT_SORTED` flag.

`FT_SORTED` flag means that Mroonga must sort search result set, then return it to MySQL. MySQL just returns it as response because result set is already sorted by storage engine - Mroonga.

In the previous versions of Mroonga had not implemented this feature.

It improves compatibility with MySQL and may be able to reduce sorting in MySQL.

### Conclusion
