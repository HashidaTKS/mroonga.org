## Mroonga 12.04 has been released!

Mroonga is a MySQL storage engine that supports fast fulltext search
and geolocation search. It is CJK ready. It uses Groonga as a storage
and fulltext search engine.

[Mroonga 12.04](/docs/news.html#release-12-04) has been released!

* How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)
* How to upgrade: [Upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade.html)

### Changes

The main changes are as follows.

### Improvements

* [Server variables](/docs/reference/server_variables.html) Add a new status variable ``Mroonga_memory_map_size``.

  We can get the total memory map size in bytes of Mroonga as below.

    ```
    mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Mroonga_memory_map_size';
    +-------------------------+----------+
    | Variable_name           | Value    |
    +-------------------------+----------+
    | Mroonga_memory_map_size | 83406848 |
    +-------------------------+----------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)
    ```

  In Windows, If Mroonga uses up physical memory and swap area, Mroonga can't more mapping memory than that.
  Therefore, we can control properly memory map size by monitoring this value even if the environment does have not enough memory.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for Percona Server 8.0.28-19.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for Percona Server 5.7.38-41.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for MariaDB 10.2.44, 10.3.35, 10.4.25, 10.5.16, 10.6.8, and 10.7.4.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug that Mroonga may update failed.

  If this bug occurs, Mroonga is disabled after Mroonga update with such as "apt update".
  In that case, we install Mroonga manually with the following procedure.

    ```
    % mysql -u root < /usr/share/mroonga/install.sql
    ```

### Conclusion

Let's search by Mroonga!
