Mroonga is a MySQL storage engine that supports fast fulltext search
and geolocation search. It is CJK ready. It uses Groonga as a storage
and fulltext search engine.

[Mroonga 6.09](/docs/news.html#release-6-09) has been released!

  * How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)
  * How to upgrade: [Upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade.html)

### Changes

Here is the topic in this release.

  * Supported nonexistent reference insert check for FOREIGN KEY

#### Supported nonexistent reference insert check for FOREIGN KEY

In the previous versions, there is no support about reference insert check for FOREIGN KEY.

    create table HOGES( 
      ID         INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
      HOGE       VARCHAR(255)
    ) ENGINE=Mroonga;
    create table FOODS( 
      ID         INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
      HOGE_ID    INT(10),
      FOO        VARCHAR(255),
      foreign key(HOGE_ID) references HOGES(ID)
    ) ENGINE=Mroonga ;
  
so, invalid data was inserted without error if you use above schema.

Note that FOREIGN KEY check doesn't work for old version of MySQL and folks such as MySQL 5.5 or MariaDB 5.5, and FOREIGN KEY check for INSERT/DELETE is not supported yet. (it will be supported in the future release!)

### Conclusion

Please refer to [Release 6.09 - 2016-09-29](/docs/news.html#release-6-09-2016-09-29) about detailed changes since 6.08.
