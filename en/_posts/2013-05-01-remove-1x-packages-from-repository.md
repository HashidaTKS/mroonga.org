## Removed 1.x packages from repository

We had released mroonga 3.03 Apr 29, 2013. At that time, we also
reorganized self hosted mroonga repository.

Because mroonga 1.x is the seriese of two generation ago.

We had reorganized repository by following rule:

-   version 1.x packages
-   unsupported release

By rule 1, we had removed groonga 1.x and mroonga 1.x packages from
repository. By rule 2, we had removed packages matched to following
release from repositry.

-   Fedora 15
-   Fedora 16
-   Fedora 17
-   Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat discontinued Apr, 2012)
-   Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal discontinued Oct, 2012)
