### Supported Groonga 5.0.6

Supported Groonga 5.0.6. See [release announce](http://groonga.org/en/blog/2015/07/29/release.html) for summary, see [News](http://groonga.org/docs/news.html#release-5-0-6) for details.

### Dropped Ubuntu 14.10 Utopic support

Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn) had been reached End of Life (EOL) on July 23, 2015. Thus, we decide to end of support for Ubuntu 14.10.
Groonga PPA for Ubuntu 14.10 will no longer update. Previous version (5.0.5) is the final version of support Ubuntu Utopic.
We recommend to upgrade to newer version (such as 15.04).

### Fixed a bug for multiple column index with range condition

Fixed a bug that search results are reduced for multiple column index with range condition (e.g. ``<`` in ``WHERE date < '2015-07-01'``).
Thanks to a report from a user. See the following thread of mailing list (Japanese) for details.
