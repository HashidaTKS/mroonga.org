#### Added [`mroonga_boolean_mode_syntax_flags`](/docs/reference/server_variables.html#mroonga-boolean-mode-syntax-flag)

You can custom syntax in `MATCH () AGAINST ('...' IN BOOLEAN MODE)` by `mroonga_boolean_mode_syntax_flags`. In other words, you can use Groonga syntax.

If you can use Groonga syntax, you can use more features but it's incompatible with MySQL's standard syntax.

See [`mroonga_boolean_mode_syntax_flags` document](/docs/reference/server_variables.html#mroonga-boolean-mode-syntax-flag) for details.

#### Supported `FULLTEXT INDEX` without normalizer

You can create `FULLTEXT INDEX` without normalizer by `FULLTEXT INDEX (...) COMMENT 'normalizer "none"`.
