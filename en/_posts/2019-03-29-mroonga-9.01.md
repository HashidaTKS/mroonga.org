[Mroonga 9.01](/docs/news.html#release-9-01) has been released!

* How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)
* How to upgrade: [Upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade.html)

### Changes

The main changes are as follows.

  * Added support for latest MariaDB/Percona Server.
  * Added support for building bundled MariaDB package on AppVeyor.

### Added support for latest MariaDB/Percona Server

In this release, the following latest MariaDB/Percona Server has been supported.

* Percona Server 5.7.25-28.
* MariaDB 10.3.13.
* MariaDB 10.2.23.

### Added support for building bundled MariaDB package on AppVeyor

In the previous versions, we use AppVeyor just for testing build on Windows.
So, release package for Windows had been built manually.

This situation is gradually improved to build package itself on AppVeyor.
Currently, there is some more fix because packages are based on master version, so it should be fixed to use latest release as a official Windows package.

When the rest issue is fixed, Mroonga package is also available as artifacts from:

* [Mroonga CI on AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/groonga/mroonga)


### Conclusion
