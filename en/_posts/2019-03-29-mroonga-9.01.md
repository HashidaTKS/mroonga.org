* How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)
* How to upgrade: [Upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade.html)

### Changes

The main changes are as follows.

  * Improved support for more table and comment parameter about tokenizer/nomalizer/indexes.
  * Added support for latest MariaDB/Percona Server.
  * Added support for building bundled MariaDB package on AppVeyor.

### Improved support for table and comment parameter about tokenizer/nomalizer/indexes

In this release, tokenizer/nomalizer/indexes support is improved.

In storage mode, you can specify tokenizer options in `COMMENT` section.

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (...) COMMENT='tokenizer "TokenNgram('n', 4)"'
```

Note that `default_tokenizer` is deprecated. use `tokenizer` instead.

You can also specify `LEXICON` index parameter.

```sql
FULLTEXT INDEX foo (bar) LEXICON='terms'
```

or

```
FULLTEXT INDEX foo (bar) COMMENT 'lexicon "terms"'
```

for MariaDB, `TOKENIZER`, `NORMALIER` and `TOKEN_FILTERS` table parameter has been supported.

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (...) TOKENIZER='TokenNgram("n", 4)'
CREATE TABLE foo (...) NORMALIZER='NormalizerNFKC100("unify_kana", true)'
CREATE TABLE foo (...) TOKEN_FILTERS='TokenFilterNFKC100("unify_katakana_v_sounds", true)'
```


### Added support for latest MariaDB/Percona Server

In this release, the following latest MariaDB/Percona Server has been supported.

* Percona Server 5.7.25-28.
* MariaDB 10.3.13.
* MariaDB 10.2.23.

### Added support for building bundled MariaDB package on AppVeyor

In the previous versions, we use AppVeyor just for testing build on Windows.
So, release package for Windows had been built manually.

This situation is gradually improved to build package itself on AppVeyor.
Currently, there is some more fix because packages are based on master version, so it should be fixed to use latest release as a official Windows package.

When the rest issue is fixed, Mroonga package is also available as artifacts from:

* [Mroonga CI on AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/groonga/mroonga)


### Conclusion

See [Release 9.01 - 2019-03-29](/docs/news.html#release-9-01) about detailed changes since 9.00.
