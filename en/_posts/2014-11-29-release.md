It seems that Mroonga is not enabled by default, please install Mroonga in the advance:

    INSTALL PLUGIN Mroonga SONAME 'ha_mroonga.so';
    CREATE FUNCTION last_insert_grn_id RETURNS INTEGER SONAME 'ha_mroonga.so';
    CREATE FUNCTION mroonga_snippet RETURNS STRING SONAME 'ha_mroonga.so';
    CREATE FUNCTION mroonga_command RETURNS STRING SONAME 'ha_mroonga.so';
