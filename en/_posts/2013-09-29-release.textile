Here is the topic for this release:

* Supported REPAIR TABLE for broken groonga database

h3. Supported REPAIR TABLE for broken groonga database

In this release, we began to support REPAIR TABLE for broken groonga database.

This is the fix not to run into a trouble during repairing tables.

If there is no mrn file (groonga's database file), there is a problem that you can't execute REPAIR TABLE. Now that limitation is discarded.

Even if you backup wrapped storage engine's file only, you can restore by REPAIR TABLE.

h3. Conclusion

See "Release 3.08 - 2013/09/29":/docs/news.html#release-3-08 about detailed changes since 3.07.

Let's search by mroonga!
